### [Course 01: Stanford CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](/cs231n-2019)

The course "Stanford CS231n" (http://cs231n.stanford.edu) is a course on computer vision with neural networks titled “Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition” taught at Stanford University. This course is famous for being both early (started in 2015 just three years after the AlexNet breakthrough), and for being free, with videos and slides available.

The focus of the course is the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision problems, with a focus on how CNNs work, image classification and recognition tasks, and introduction to advanced applications such as generative models and deep reinforcement learning.

This project is an effort to personalize this material by creating new notebooks from scratch that are relevant for my learning journey.
